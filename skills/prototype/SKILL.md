description: Build a throwaway prototype to flesh out a design before committing to it. Routes between two branches — a runnable terminal app for state/business-logic questions, or several radically different UI variations toggleable from one route. Use when the user wants to prototype, sanity-check a data model or state machine, explore design options, or says "prototype this", "let me play with it", "try a few designs".

# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered — from the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md). Build a tiny interactive terminal app that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper.
- **"What should this look like?"** → [UI.md](UI.md). Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts — getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and isolated as such.** Every prototype lives under a `prototypes/` directory at the repo root, in its own subdirectory named for the session — e.g. `prototypes/checkout-state-machine/`, `prototypes/settings-redesign/`. Keeping all prototypes in one isolated tree means a casual reader never mistakes prototype code for production, and each session has a clear home. (UI prototypes that must mount on a real route are the one exception to full isolation — they wire a temporary switcher into the existing route, but the variant components themselves still live in the prototype's subdirectory. See [UI.md](UI.md).)
2. **One command to run.** Whatever the project's existing task runner supports — `pnpm <name>`, `python <path>`, `bun <path>`, etc. The user must be able to start it without thinking.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE — wipe me" name.
4. **Skip the polish.** No tests, no error handling beyond what makes the prototype _runnable_, no abstractions. The point is to learn something fast, then absorb the answer.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Keep the prototype; absorb the answer.** When the prototype has answered its question, fold the validated decision into the real code — but leave the prototype in place under `prototypes/<session>/` as a record of how you got there. Don't delete it, and don't let it leak into production paths; it stays in the `prototypes/` tree.

## When done

The _answer_ is the most important thing to carry forward from a prototype. Capture it somewhere durable (commit message, ADR, ticket, or a `NOTES.md` inside the prototype's `prototypes/<session>/` subdirectory) along with the question it was answering. If the user is around, that capture is a quick conversation; if not, leave the placeholder in `NOTES.md` so they (or you, on the next pass) can fill in the verdict. The prototype itself stays under `prototypes/` — the captured answer is what gets folded into the real code.

Beyond the original question, the user often surfaces other relevant details during a prototype session — constraints they realised, design decisions they settled, things they want to remember. Before closing out, review those with the user and ask which ones should also be absorbed into `NOTES.md` (or an ADR, ticket, etc.). Don't silently discard them.
